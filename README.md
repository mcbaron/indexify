indexify
========

This project aims to provide a useful interface for making index files automatically.

It is born out of a frustration that I've had managing a directory of matlab files with out a good way of commenting them, and understanding what files inherit traits from others. This is not really a problem that could be solved with a creative use of repositories either, as git and svn seem to consider .mat files as binaries.
